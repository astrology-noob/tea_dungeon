## Review of brainstormed ideas

Yesterday we met-up for a brainstorm session to express our ideas of the ways that we will present our company on an upcoming conference dedicated to the concept of the Internet Of Things.

### Goals of todays meeting:
- Review ideas that we wrote down yesterday
- Each participant explains their opinion on certain ideas
- Reach a consensus on the actions that will be performed on a conference

### Departments invited
Chairman: Cortney Al-Jamil (Deputy Head of Execution)

Attendees will discuss ideas and work on their part to prepare for conference
- Marketing Department (Ana Goya, Liza McDough, Eugene Fitzerbert) - define our brand
- Development Department (Chris Lockheart, Valerie Jenkins) - identify strong parts of our solution
- Head of Execution (Earle Hangman) - present our company on a conference

### Subjects that need to be covered
1) On which subject will we give presentation and which way (video, PowerPoint, real-time demonstration, etc)?
3) How to conceal our lack of experience on the international market with our presentation?
These questions already have several answers for them but we need to pick the most suitable ones.
