## Becoming an astronaut

...was an idea that never crossed my mind. I never had a friend who dreamed of becoming an astronaut, I never liked documentaries about this profession. I thought of it as a very boring and demanding job - not mentioning having to be far away from my family, which made me very anxious when I was little. The "food in tubes" was also a very unpleasant thought to me.

No matter how interesting are movies about our solar system and our universe I seem to fear cosmos, even when I'm nearly a grown-up. Huge open space without air, where you need to rely almost solely on yourself terrifies me. The "spooky stories" and plots focused on being isolated from Earth and any external help makes the fear stronger.

All in all, I am glad that I am not forced to become an astronaut and the humanity is still far away from space travelling so that I won't have to fly in space until the end of my days.
