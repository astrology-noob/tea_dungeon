Why invest in space exploration:

1. Understanding how space works helps us understand Earth
2. It broadens our horizons and opportunities (like colonization, etc.)
3. It's fun
4. It keeps smart people busy (a lot of employees in this area)
5. It cultivates the thought that we are not the center of the universe and thus reduces stress level, because - why worry if your life means nothing on the scale of the Universe?
6. Some inventions we use everyday were made due to space exploration (like memory foam, cordless tools, etc.)
