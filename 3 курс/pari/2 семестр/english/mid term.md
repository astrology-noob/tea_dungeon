# Task #1

1. "There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book." Why do you think Wilde said this? Do you agree?

There is nothing entirely moral or immoral in our world. Everything, especially works of art, can be interpreted in any way and if desired, you can find something evil and sinister even in children's books. That is why I agree with Oscar Wilde - there is just no book that is entirely moral, such writing that everyone will find flawless representation of morality. 
Also, at that time homosexual people greatly suffered from misjudging and I think that Oscar Wilde partly meant by this sentence that if someone saw presumably homosexual characters in his books as something immoral, that it was their decision.

2. Do you find any of the characters believable? Why or why not? 

I think that any of the characters is believable, but as characters, not real people. Their "sins" are what makes them believable to me. They are not 100% kind and compassionate, they can annoy each other, they influence each other. They come close to being like real people, but they are just tools for telling the story but it is not bad.

3. Is Dorian Gray an antihero?

Well, according to the definition of an antihero, I think we can call Dorian Gray an antihero. We read his story, but he brings chaos and death everywhere he goes.
Even though Dorian strikes as pure caricature villain near the end, it just makes sense with all life experience he went through. And even then when we think that he is irredeemable, that he isn't going to stop and will continue live his life the way it is, he shows regret in his action but is too blinded by hate and selfishness blaming all that's happened to him on Basil and the portrait as if he'd had nothing to do with it. He has traits that fit for an antihero, whose story is interesting and might teach someone a lesson.

4. If you were one of the characters in the novel, would you be friends with Dorian? Why or why not?

I don't like Dorian's personality not before nor after the portrait. I don't think that we would find anything in common. Actually, I would want him as far from me as possible.

5. At the time of its publication, _The Picture of Dorian Gray_ sparked countless debates about the role of morality in art. What is your opinion? Do artists have the responsibility to convey good morals to their audience?

I think artists have a right to make what they want. Making a work of art shouldn't come with obligations of educating people and making them better. Adult people come up with the meanings themselves, oftenly ending up far away from what author might have intended. Specifically adults. In my opinion children should be taught about how to be harmless towards nature and other people and how to make our world a better place. After some experience adults can change their mind multiple times and it is also important for a self discovery. Art helps with understanding that the world is cruel, that there are harmful things and people. But art also can bring hope despite all that.
I am very lost in this subject. My every sentence is making me question things further and I think I will spiral more if I don't stop answering now :)
