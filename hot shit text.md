Now and then, we all get a thought  
That stops us in our tracks  
Am I living to my full potential?  
Or am I holding myself back?  
  
You gotta stop with that shit, 'cause you're  
P-P-Perfect!  
Shake off that analysis paralysis (Paralysis!)  
If you need some help to see  
Take a lesson from space  
They say "Pluto's not a planet,"  
Do you think that Pluto gives a shit?  
  
Pluto is not gonna quit  
'Cause Pluto can take a hit  
And Pluto knows what Pluto is  
And Pluto knows that Pluto's  
  
Hot shit!  
And you know Pluto knows it  
"I won't ever be a planet, it don't matter, 'cause I know that I'm still"  
Hot shit!  
And you're hot shit too, so get out of your brain and just do what you're supposed to do!  
Hot shit!  
And you know Pluto knows it  
Expect some fuckin' magic from the Dwarf Planet (Heyyy!)  
Hot shit!  
And you're hot shit too, so get out of your way and just do what you were born to do!  
  
Before Pluto got wise and said  
"Gosh dang it!"  
It's true, Pluto was jealous of them  
Big other planets  
But did you know that Jupiter, the biggest by far  
Was also jealous cause the dorks on Earth called him a failed star?  
  
The star that he was jealous of was called our Sun  
Who was herself consumed with thoughts that she would never become  
A big black hole, she would constantly chase  
The dream to be so big that she could eat time and space  
  
10 quadrillion miles away a place the sun could not see  
There sat a bad bitch suckin' up reality  
Who turned her gaze into the center of our galaxy  
And said "When I'm supermassive, yeah, I'll be happy."  
  
But the biggest, baddest, supermassive thing to exist  
Spun in the middle of them all and said  
" I think I'm seeing shit. "  
  
I've seen a perfect protostar  
I've seen a triple quasar, but  
I've never seen a dwarf planet go this hard!  
  
Hot shit!  
And you know Pluto knows it  
"I don't need to be a planet, 'cause I know that I'm still worth it, baby! "  
Hot shit!  
And you're hot shit too, so stop doubting yourself and just feel this cosmic groove!  
Hot shit!  
And you know Pluto knows it  
Expect some fuckin' naughty from this heavenly body! (Heyyy!)  
Hot shit!  
And you're hot shit too, so look up to the stars, the universe was made for you!  
  
Now and then, I get the thought  
That stops me in my tracks  
" Am I talking about space too much? I really try to cut back. "  
  
I gotta stop with that shit cause I'm P-P-Perfect!  
Space is fucking cool, and so are you if you let me talk about space with you!  
  
Hot shit!  
And you know that I know it, aha!  
I won't ever be an astronaut  
But I'm still hot like Halley's Comet!  
Hot shit!  
And you're hot shit too, so let's shoot for the stars, I bet we'll land on the moon!  
Hot shit!  
  
Do ya' like ma' space metaphor?  
Hot shit!  
Would you like to know what I use it for?  
To prove to you that you are hot shit too  
Now get out of my room  
And show this planet what hot shit do!  
(Hot Shit!)
